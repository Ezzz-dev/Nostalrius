# Nostalrius 7.7
Nostalrius is a 7.7 clone project that has been in development for a long time, it is based on TheForgottenServer 1.2 fork.

  - You can find here the most complete 7.72 Tibia replica that has ever been made
  - Nostalrius is by 2021, deprecated, and it is far from being a clone to Tibia, only The Violet Project is a true clone.
